<p>Assess the fate of Neotropical forests requires to accurately measures forest diversity and reliably monitor forest communities. The costs of botanical inventories and the taxonomic complexity of Neotropical forests make forest inventories in vernacular names the most efficient approach today, although these hold high botanical uncertainty and limit the accuracy of diversity measures. Several methods were proposed to compensate these botanical uncertainties but none reliably assessed functional and fine-scale diversity surveys. We developed a polyvalent diversity estimator workable in numerous specific cases based on the propagation of botanical uncertainties. The estimator was calibrated with a large neotropical inventory and the simulations of uncertainty and sampling effort gradients allowed to determined an ideal inventory protocol optimizing the costs and the accuracy of forest inventories. Our study first advocated of necessity of real inventories and the inescapable recourse to taxonomists to ensure reliable diversity estimations. An ideal inventory protocol based on a sampling effort of XX trees and on an identification effort of 80% of the species was identified and ensured diversity estimations with a 10% error.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The variety of tree species, their assemblages in space and their dynamics in time are determinant of forests productivity and functioning <span class="citation">(Cardinale et al. 2012)</span>. Preserve tree diversity is crucial to maintain forests functioning and services, specifically in hyper-diverse tropical forests where the biodiversity is as threatened as it is valuable and unexplored <span class="citation">(Barlow et al. 2018)</span>. Handling the conservation and management of tree diversity requires setting sensible protection areas and sustainable forest management calibrated according to diversity patterns in space and time and their determinants <span class="citation">(Margules and Pressey 2000; Purvis and Hector 2000; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Gibson2011a"><strong>???</strong></span>; FAO 2014; Sist et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Correctly measure, map and manage forests biodiversity require accurate and large forest monitoring. The precision of forest inventories, though, is often limited by their significant cost in terms of time, money, and logistic <span class="citation">(Feeley and Silman 2011; Baraloto et al. 2013)</span>. Sampling methods were optimized to minimize these costs and maximize inventory accuracy.Some approaches would restrict inventories to some DBH or height classes, to specific taxa, or would opt for inventories at family or genus level. These methods efficiently translated biodiversity patterns at regional scales and along wide ecological gradients <span class="citation">(H. T. Steege et al. 2000; Higgins and Ruokolainen 2004; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2011; Pos et al. 2014)</span>. However, these methods were either limited to small areas (under 1ha), sometimes remained biased or holding significant uncertainty, and usually proved limited to detect subtle diversity aspects and to desentangle richness from equitability parameters <span class="citation">(O. Phillips et al. 2003; Baraloto et al. 2013; Guitet et al. 2014 ; Vellend, Lilley, and Starzomski 2008; Prance 1994)</span>. Another approach proposed to use inventories in vernacular names instead of botanical species. Vernacular names indeed are easier to attribute, more common and usually do not require vouchers collection or posterior botanical identification. The reliability of vernacular names may be high at genus level, but this proved highly variable across tropical regions: while this reliability was estimated around 60-70% in French Guiana <span class="citation">(Hawes et al. 2012; Guitet et al. 2014)</span> to ranges from 32% to 67% in Central Africa <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2011)</span>. The multiple and variable associations between botanical and vernacular names then entail significant botanical uncertainties that should not be ignored <span class="citation">(Oldeman 1968)</span>. Besides, rough vernacular inventories would not allow functional and phylogenetic approaches, that require identification at the botanical species to comply with phylogenetic and functional database. However the approach through vernacular names deserves further attention. First, it gives the opportunity to analyze pre-logging inventories conducted in large areas by logging companies. Second, as exhaustive inventories, they allow some post-process based on vernacular/botanical names association and allow the building of reliable diversity estimators <span class="citation">(Steege et al. 2006; Feldpausch et al. 2006; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2008; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2011)</span>. Following this idea <span class="citation">Guitet et al. (2014)</span> proposed a framework propagating vernacular names taxonomic uncertainties in diversity measures. The propagation framework was based on Monte-Carlo processes estimating forest diversity from the vernacular-botanical name association. These association combined prior information from both general taxa-abundance correspondence table <span class="citation">(J. Molino et al. 2009)</span> and reference field inventories. The framework successfully rendered the ranking of plots diversity, but remained restricted to large environmental gradient and for highly different communities <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2014; Guitet et al. 2013)</span>. In this study we offer to refine this framework and adapt it to diversity estimation at smaller spatial scales. The following diversity estimator is based on the specific case of the studied community and the inventory protocol. The diversity estimator besides suits all inventories whatever the ratio of botanical determination, <em>i.e.</em> ratio of vernacular compared to botanical names. It besides suits experimental specific as well as pre-logging inventories where only the commercial or most recognizable species are identified at species level.</p>
<p>Such diversity estimator allows maximizing the accuracy of diversity measures while minimizing the sampling effort, <em>i.e.</em> the size of inventoried communities and the number of accurately identified species. In this perspective we thought to calibrate an ideal inventory protocol optimized in terms of sampling effort and determination degree. From a real inventory, with complete vernacular and botanical identifications, we simulated ranges of sampling efforts and identification degrees along which we examined the bias and variability of the diversity estimator.</p>
<p>In this study we <em>(i)</em> redesigned a diversity estimator based on a Bayesian framework accounting for both general taxa-association tables and specific field inventories, and <em>(ii)</em> applied the estimator to a real Neotropical forest inventory to determine the sampling effort and determination degree of an ideal inventory protocol.</p>
