<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The variety of tree species, their assemblages in space and their dynamics in time are determinant for forests ecological functions and productivity <span class="citation">(Magurran 1988; Cardinale et al. 2012)</span>. It is crucial to maintain this diversity, especially in tropical forests where trees diversity is as threatened as it is valuable and unexplored <span class="citation">(Koh et Sodhi 2010)</span>. Maintain the diversity of tropical ecosystems requires setting protection areas and implementing sustainable forest management correctly calibrated through the assessment of spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns and their determinants <span class="citation">(Margules et Pressey 2000; Purvis et Hector 2000; Gibson et al. 2011; FAO 2014; Sist et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In that respect a large panel of diversity indices have been developed, constituting a refine framework catching all aspects of communities’ diversity <span class="citation">(Whittaker 1972; Purvis et Hector 2000)</span>. Here we used the family of q-generalized or Tsallis entropy, converted into equivalent number of species <span class="citation">(Hill 1973; Keylock 2005; Jost 2006)</span>. The diversities of this family derive from a unique formula, modulated by an order q that is the power to which is raised species frequency:</p>
<p>$ ^qD = (_{i=1}^{N} p_i<sup>q)</sup> $</p>
<p>In this formula <em>q</em> is the order of the diversity and <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> the relative abundance of species <em>i</em> in a community of <em>N</em> species. The order <em>q</em> determines the weight of species abundance in the metric: the higher the order, the higher the emphasis on common vs. rare species. A range of order <em>q</em> browses different balance between richness and evenness: for <em>q</em> = 0 the formula retrieves species richness, for <em>q</em> = 1 this is Shannon diversity that equally accounts for the richness and evenness components and for <em>q</em> = 2 this is the Simpson diversity as can be understood as the diversity of common species.</p>
<p>These tools though are based on forest inventories that require significant time, costs, and logistic <span class="citation">(Feeley et Silman 2011)</span>. To respond these difficulties it has been proposed to reduce the inventory effort in focusing on some DBH, height classes or some particular taxa, or by leading inventories at family or genus level. These methods efficiently reflected biodiversity patterns at regional scales and along wide ecological gradients <span class="citation">(Steege et al. 2000; Higgins et Ruokolainen 2004; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2011; Pos et al. 2014)</span> but they did not clearly disentangled the richness and evenness components of diversity. They would miss the needs of studies at smaller time and spatial scale which involve faint variation, particularly in the Neotropics where the diversity of tree species is particularly large and complex <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2014 ; Vellend, Lilley, et Starzomski 2008; Prance 1994)</span>. These restricting methods besides miss the needs of functional and phylogenetic approaches that are workable only with botanical names, to comply with phylogenetic trees and global trait database. Other methods proposed were rather interested in optimizing the sampling method of inventoried areas <span class="citation">(Phillips et al. 2003; Baraloto, Molto, et al. 2012)</span> but even then only small areas (under 1ha) were reasonably practicable because of the cost of high taxonomic resolution and the estimation of diversity remained uncertain, biased and the effects on richness and equitability still entangled.</p>
<p>It was also proposed to use inventories in vernacular names because they easier to attribute, more widely known and do not require vouchers collection or posterior botanical identification. Inventories in vernacular names besides already encompass the numerous forest inventories that logging companies conduct to quantify the available resources <span class="citation">(Steege et al. 2006; Feldpausch et al. 2006; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2008; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2011)</span>. The use of vernacular names successfully highlighted biodiversity patterns at regional scale and along large ecological gradients <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2014)</span> but a clear and precise framework still need be developed. Vernacular names bear significant taxonomic uncertainty because they may correspond to several taxon, which besides depends of the field team <span class="citation">(Oldeman 1968)</span>. This taxonomic uncertainty should be correctly accounted for in the measure of diversity, as done by <span class="citation">Guitet et al. (2014)</span>. They developed a framework based on Monte-Carlo process using the association between botanical and vernacular names, estimated through both general taxa-abundance table <span class="citation">(Molino et al. 2009)</span> and reference field botanical inventories. Their framework successfully rendered the ranking of plots diversity, their results came from the study of a large environmental gradient and highly different communities <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2014; Guitet et al. 2013)</span>. We took up this framework to refine it and adapt it to the study of smaller time and spatial scales. The new framework proposed besides accounts for the specificities of the field teams and the studied community. It can also be applied whenever ratio of botanical determination in the initial inventory, be it partly or fully in vernacular names. In some cases indeed only the commercial or most recognizable species are directly identified at species level. This handling of several determination ratio could also give interesting application like promoting basic botanical formation for field workers to ensure a minimum determination ratio: this could be a small investment that highly increases the value of logging inventories for ecological surveys. Specifically we <em>(i)</em> revised the propagation Bayesian framework to account for both general taxa-association tables and reference field inventories. We extended the framework to analyze partly identified forest inventories and explored the impact of the different ratio of botanical determination on the performance of diversity estimators. <em>(ii)</em> We calibrated the framework using six 6.25ha plots from a tropical rainforest stand in French Guyana and determined the ideal balance between general taxa-association table and reference field inventories. We then determined the minimal sampling effort to be invested in the reference field inventories to have a correct estimation of diversity.</p>
