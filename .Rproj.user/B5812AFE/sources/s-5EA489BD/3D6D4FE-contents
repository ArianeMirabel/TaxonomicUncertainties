## DB file

- *UncertGrad_Expert*, *UncertGrad_ExpObs* & *UncertGrad_Observed*: The three files list the Richness, Shannon and Simpson values measured along a gradient of simulated uncertainty. This correspond to 300 simulations of the gradient and allows to plot Figure 1.

- *SampEffGrad*: Lists the Richness, Shannon and Simpson values along a gradient of simulated sampling effort (*i.e* number of trees considered to compute the association vectors $\alpha$)
